//28
//00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:44,542
//Why did you go to the police?

//
//29
//00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,778
//What do you want of me? Tell me

//
//35
//00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:37,029
//I can't remember the last time
//you invited me for a cup of coffee.
//
//36
//00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,797
//Even though my wife is godmother

//You never wanted my friendship.

//41
//00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,220
//You found Paradise in America.
//
//42
//00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:07,325
//You made a good living, had police
//protection and there were courts of law.
//
//43
//00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:10,158
//You didn't need a friend like me.
//
//44
//00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,292
//But now you come to me and say,
//
//45
//00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,270
//"Don Corleone, give me justice."
//
//46
//00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,542
//But you don't ask with respect.
//
//47

//You don't offer friendship. You don't
//even think to call me Godfather.
